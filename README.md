# Linux Kernel Module – Bar Stool Management System

A Linux kernel module project implementing a bar stool management system with mutex-based synchronization and system call interfaces.

Kernel-level simulation of bar stool and table management using a Linux kernel module written in C.  
This project demonstrates system calls, concurrency control, and mutex-based synchronization in an operating system environment.

**Course:** Operating Systems (COP4610) – Florida State University  
**Language:** C  
**Environment:** Linux Kernel Module

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the Operating Systems course at Florida State University.

The goal of the project was to design and implement a Linux kernel module that simulates the management of bar tables and stools. The module demonstrates concepts related to system calls, concurrency, synchronization, and kernel-level resource management.

## Features
- Linux kernel module implementation in C
- System call tracing
- Concurrent resource management
- Mutex-based synchronization
- Simulation of customer seating and server actions

## My Contribution
Contributed to the implementation and testing of the kernel module including:

- Development of group management logic for resource allocation
- Implementation of mutex-based synchronization mechanisms
- Integration and debugging of kernel module components
- Testing and validation of concurrent kernel behavior

## Build & Run

Requirements:

- Linux environment
- GCC compiler
- Kernel module build support

Compilation:

```
make
sudo insmod bar.ko
sudo rmmod bar
```

## Kernel Module Execution

### Build

The kernel module was successfully compiled using the Linux kernel build system.

### Module Loaded

The module was inserted into the kernel using `insmod` and verified with `lsmod`.

### Kernel Logs

Kernel logs confirm that the module initialized correctly.

![dmesg](images/dmesg.png)

Example output:

```
Bar Module: initializing
Mutexes initialized
Bar Module: initialized : successfully
```

### Module Removal

The module was removed successfully using `rmmod`.
